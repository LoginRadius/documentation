This document provides instructions to integrate the LoginRadius User Registration Service or Social Login in an iOS app.

> **Disclaimer**

> This library is meant to help you with a quick implementation of the LoginRadius platform and also to serve as a reference point for the LoginRadius API. Keep in mind that it is an open-source library, which means you are free to download and customize the library functions based on your specific application needs.

> This version is a complete revamp of the previous SDK. Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/LoginRadius/ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

```
$ gem install cocoapods
